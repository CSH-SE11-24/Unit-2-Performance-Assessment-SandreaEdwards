<h1> Mercy </h1>
<p> A D&D inspired game that allows you to make decisions and forms the game based on your choices. This game is cap-sensitive. Every choice made must be typed out with proper capitalization.</p>

<p> EX. If the program asks: "What do you want for dinner (Mac and cheese / Steak)" You would answer: "Steak" or you would answer "Mac and cheese" (without adding "") This is a typing and reading game, so be prepared to type and read! The story is incomplete, this game is a demo. Maybe I'll work on it in the future, but let me know any feedback or critisim you have after playing. If I had more time I would complete the game but I'm really proud of my choice based game style</p>
